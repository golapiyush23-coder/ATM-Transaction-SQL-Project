# ATM-Transaction-SQL-Project
In this project, I analyzed the ATM transaction data-set from the root using advanced SQL queries to find out why transactions are not happening in the ATM machine, whether some transactions are failing, which type of account's transactions are failing, is there less money in the account, any specific time when the transaction failed, etc.
